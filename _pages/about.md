I am a final-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbanaâ€“Champaign. Prior to this, I earned my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology from Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

My research interests include large language models (LLMs), long-form text generation, knowledge-augmented generation, and reasoning with LLMs.
